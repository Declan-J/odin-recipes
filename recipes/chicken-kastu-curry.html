    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <div>
      <ol>
        <li>Pre-heat the Oven to 200°C</li>
        <li>
          Start by adding the onion & carrots into a deep non-stick frying pan
          along with the coconut oil. Gently fry on a medium/ low heat for
          around 5 minutes. Season with salt.
        </li>
        <li>
          After this time, add the minced garlic, curry powder, ginger,
          turmeric, honey, soy sauce and flour with a splash of the chicken
          stock. Gently fry for another minute before gradually adding all of
          the chicken stock. Reduce to a simmer and set the timer for 20
          minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Meanwhile, prepare the chicken by slicing the 3 breasts along the
          width to create 6 thin chicken pieces. Start the crispy chicken
          conveyor belt by rolling it in flour, then the beaten egg and finally
          in the breadcrumbs. If you want the crispiest chicken, dip into the
          egg and breadcrumbs one more time (may require more breadcrumbs).
        </li>
        <li>
          Drizzle half of the rapeseed oil onto a large baking try and add the
          battered chicken. Then drizzle the remaining rapeseed oil over the top
          to coat. Pop in the oven, timer set to 12 minutes to rotate and cook
          for a further 12 minutes on the other side.
        </li>
        <li>
          In the meantime, cook the rice according to packet instructions.
        </li>
        <li>
          After 20 minutes, the katsu sauce should have thickened slightly so
          it's ready to blend. Slice the chicken diagonally and serve up with a
          portion of rice, a ladle of the sauce and the optional sliced spring
          onion & chilli flakes.
